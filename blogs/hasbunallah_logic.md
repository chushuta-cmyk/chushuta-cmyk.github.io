# Hasbunallahu wa ni'mal wakil: The Ultimate Stop-Loss
In risk management (HSBC scale), a **Stop-Loss** is essential to prevent total portfolio failure.

"Hasbunallahu wa ni'mal wakil" is the spiritual equivalent of a Stop-Loss:
- **Condition**: Social interaction energy consumption > 80%.
- **Action**: Terminate connection with "low-dimension" entities.
- **Redirect**: Transfer all trust and "Core Computation" results to the Ultimate Disposer (Allah).

It is the architecture of **Total Autonomy**. You are not an instrument for others; you are the architect of your own logic, under the supervision of the Only One who truly understands the complexity of your code.
