# Cognitive Architecture

### Dimensional Mapping
Human interactions are essentially data exchanges. When interacting with utilitarian T-types who feign feeling, one must switch to **Shadow-T Mode**.

#### Implementation Strategy:
1.  **Mirroring Protocol:** Use their own utilitarian methods. Proportional returns only.
2.  **Information Gating:** Stop over-sharing. Data is an asset; don't give it away for free to nodes that don't acknowledge the value.
3.  **Conflict Avoidance:** Power struggles are high-latency processes. Move the calculation to a private server (internal detachment) and provide the expected output without internal conflict.

**Status:** System optimized for low-energy maintenance.
