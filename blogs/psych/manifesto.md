# The Architecture of Cognitive Detachment

### 1. The Entropy of Human Interaction
Every social interaction is a data exchange that consumes CPU cycles (cognitive energy). In an unoptimized system, "One-Sided Empathy" acts as a memory leak, draining resources without providing systemic feedback. 

### 2. The Firewall Protocol
To maintain high-performance output in complex fields like Bioinformatics, one must implement an **Emotional Firewall**:
* **Packet Filtering:** Distinguish between "Authentic Signals" and "Utilitarian Noise."
* **Dimensional Shielding:** Do not project high-dimensional logic onto nodes operating in 1D self-interest. 

### 3. Systematic Conclusion
True detachment is not the absence of emotion, but the ultimate optimization of energy. We preserve our "High-Throughput" for the systems and individuals that align with our core logic.
