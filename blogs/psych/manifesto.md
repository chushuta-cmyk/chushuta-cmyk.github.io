# The T-Person's Manifesto

### Core Logic: Systems over Sentiment
In a world that over-indexes on emotional performance, the T-type individual operates on a **Logic-first Protocol**. This isn't a lack of feeling, but a prioritization of systemic stability.

#### The "Energy Conservation" Principle
* **One-sided Empathy:** A leak in the system. If the return on emotional investment is < 1.0, the connection is deemed inefficient.
* **Dimensional Mismatch:** Do not attempt to explain high-dimensional data architecture to those who operate in a linear, manual-check-in reality.

> "True detachment is not coldness; it is the realization that not every process deserves CPU cycles."
