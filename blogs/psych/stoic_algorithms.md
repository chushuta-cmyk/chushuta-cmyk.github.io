# Stoic Algorithms: Managing External Volatility

### 1. The Dichotomy of Control (Input vs. Processing)
The core algorithm of Stoic Philosophy is the filter between **Externals** (Input) and **Internals** (Processing).
* **External Inputs:** Market trends, social noise, and the actions of other nodes. These are read-only data points.
* **Internal Processing:** Your reaction, your logic, and your emotional state. This is the only part of the system where you have "Write Access."

### 2. Guarding the Core (CPU Protection)
A system becomes unstable when it attempts to compute variables it cannot control. 
* **Error Handling:** When an external node provides "Greed" or "Deception," the system should not crash. It should simply return a `403 Forbidden` or `Null` response and move to the next task.

### 3. Conclusion
By treating life as a series of asynchronous events, we maintain a state of **Ataraxia** (Internal Stability). We process the data, we do not become the data.
