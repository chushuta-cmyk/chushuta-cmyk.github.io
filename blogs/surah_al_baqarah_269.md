# Hikmah: The Sight of the Soul

> *"He grants wisdom (Hikmah) to whom He wills..."*

### 1. Beyond Data, Toward Essence
True wisdom is not the accumulation of information, but the capacity to witness the **Divine Signature** within all things. In the Sufi tradition, the world is a series of veils. Hikmah is the light that makes those veils transparent. It is not about "calculating" the world, but about **unlearning** the illusions that keep us from the Truth.

### 2. The Scarcity of the Awakened Heart
This wisdom is described as a "selective grant" because it requires the heart to be a polished mirror, free from the dust of worldly desires (*Dunya*). While the mind seeks to divide and measure, the wise soul seeks to unify and witness.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Not of vulnerabilities, but of Grace. 
* **Strategic Prudence:** The patience (*Sabr*) to wait for the soul to be ready for the light.

### 3. The "Much Good"
The "Much Good" (*Khayran Kathira*) is the ultimate state of **Ataraxia**—a tranquility born not from control, but from absolute trust in the Great Plan. When you possess Hikmah, you no longer waste your vital energy on shadows; you rest in the presence of the Real (*Al-Haqq*).

> **Divine Note:** Knowledge is a burden if it does not lead to Love. Wisdom is the wings that transform that burden into the flight of the soul.
