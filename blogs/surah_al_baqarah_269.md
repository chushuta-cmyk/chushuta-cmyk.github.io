# Al-Baqarah 269: The Epistemology of Wisdom

> *"He grants wisdom to whom He wills; and whoever has been granted wisdom has certainly been granted much good."*

### 1. Defining "Hikmah" in Systemic Logic
In the context of information theory, **Hikmah (Wisdom)** can be defined as the ability to extract the **Signal** from the **Noise**. It is not merely the accumulation of data (Knowledge), but the mastery of the underlying "Algorithm" that governs the data.

### 2. The Scarcity of High-Order Logic
The verse implies that Wisdom is a selective grant. In professional and intellectual spheres, this manifests as:
* **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying systemic vulnerabilities before they collapse.
* **Strategic Prudence:** The ability to calculate the long-term entropy of a decision rather than seeking immediate local optima.

### 3. The "Much Good" (Khayran Kathira)
The "Much Good" mentioned is the ultimate systemic efficiency. One who operates with Wisdom conserves energy, avoids parasitic cycles, and aligns with the fundamental laws of the objective reality.

> **Logic Note:** Wisdom is the final layer of the cognitive stack. Without it, even the most powerful processor (Intelligence) will waste cycles on invalid inputs.
